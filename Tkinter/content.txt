The first attempt to use Tkinter to merge the four images together.
#Currently only two images (localization and phase) are added.
There are currently problems:
  1. The filter of the phase map is too long, try to use double rows.
  2. RSS needs to add dynamic tags.
  3. The spectrum has not been completed yet.
